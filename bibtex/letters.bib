	abstract = {English. This paper aims to draw some preliminary analysis from the analyses carried out so far on the corpora collected during the first period of the Marie Curie project Last Letters from the World Wars: Forming Italian Language, Identity and Memory in Texts of Conflict. The project explores the linguistic and thematic features of the last letters of people who were sentenced to death during the two world wars. Following the creation of a corpus of letters, written by prisoners in the two world wars, substantial differences in the language and contents of these documents were revealed. These differences are due to the nature of the texts themselves and allow us to make some interesting hypotheses about a possible definition of a ‘last letter’ genre.},
